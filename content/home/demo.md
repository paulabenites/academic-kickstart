I am a Professor at [ESPOL](http://www.espol.edu.ec/) University in Guayaquil, Ecuador, where I lead the *Distributed Systems at ESPOL Lab* (DiSEL) and co-direct the Big Data Research Group. In May 2014, I obtained my PhD in Computer Science at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://www.cs.illinois.edu). Previously, I received my Master of Science degree from UIUC, funded through a Fulbright Fellowship.

My main research interests lie in the area of distributed systems, in particular systems used to support Big Data and Cloud Computing applications. At UIUC, I was a member of the [Systems Research Group](http://srg.cs.illinois.edu/), under the guidance of [Prof. Roy H. Campbell](http://cs.illinois.edu/people/faculty/roy-campbell). During my PhD studies, I was a member of the Hadoop Core Team at Yahoo, Inc. (UIUC Research Park) and also worked on several projects with [Prof. Yi Lu](http://simula.csl.illinois.edu/).

At ESPOL, I am working on several projects related to using in-memory distributed key-value stores as caches in cloud computing environments. I am mostly interested in studying and improving their performance under varying workloads. I also work in the areas of storage workload modeling and scheduling in cloud computing platforms (Hadoop, container-based microservices and serverless FaaS). My work has been funded via industry grants (Google 2016, Microsoft 2017, Google 2018, AT&T Labs 2019).

I also like to code; in particular, I like to build distributed systems. While at Yahoo, I contributed to the Apache Hadoop [codebase](https://www.google.com.ec/search?q="cristina+l+abad"+site%3Aissues.apache.org). In my free time, I sometimes answer questions on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/story/2438110).
